## Table of Contents

  - [Cinema](cinema.py)
  - [Travis](travis.py)

## Notes

“Remove” keyword is used if you know specifically what to delete; else us delete (e.g. del “list name” [index]). The reasons being that the “remove” keyword only removes the first instance.

List methods: e.g. remove, append, insert, no re-assignment required ("="), otherwise the variable will be turned into non-type; example: A = a.remove(2 -> non-type (watch out!)

Tupel vs. Lists
Tupel: Datatype/class similar to lists, but cannot be changed once created / they are immutable

## Built With

- The code challenge solutions use [Python](https://www.python.org/)
