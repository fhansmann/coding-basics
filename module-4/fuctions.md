Functions

- A function in Python is defined with the "def" keyword
- "return" is how a function gives back a value
- Functions include parameters (e.g. name, age, etc.)
- Argmuments can be formatted (format()) into a function (e.g. jack, 34, etc.)
	- Positioning argument vs. Keyword argument
- For functions, default parameters come last
- Foo function put a local variable inside the function, which will be defined by the user when the function is called
- * (star operator) for arguments ("args"): used to pack and unpack; pack arguments into a tuple inside fuctions (useful when you don't how many arguments you will have) or unpack them as arguments when you put them in to function
** for keyword arguments ("kwargs"; keyword and value): unpack keyword arguments into dictionary inside a function or pack them into a dictionary {} for your function to loop through them
