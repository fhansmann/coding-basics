## Purpose

This folder includes basic code relating to objects / object oriented programmning (OOP)

## Table of Contents

 - [Basic Bank](bank.py)

## Notes

Object Oriented Programming (OOP) - Introduction:

- Codified respresentation of real world objects
- Class: Template for e.g. coins is a class
- Classes are made of variables (states) and functions (methods)
- Objects are instances of a class
- Note that each varible type in python (e.g. string) is its own unique class (defined by states and methods)

OOP Principles:

- Encapsulation: individual states can be encapsulated
- Class inheritance: allows us to define a class that inherits all the methods and properties from another class
- Polymorthism: same function name as in the parent, but has differnt shapes, forms, versions of itself; method has mulitples forms in a class

Class constructors and class destructers:
- Construcotrs help to setup states of objects/ classes
- Constructor: def__init__(self): function with self as paramenter #self: specific instance of a class; used to construct classes states
- destructors: def__del__(self)

## Built With

- The code challenge solutions use [Python](https://www.python.org/)
