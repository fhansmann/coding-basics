## Purpose

This folder includes basic code relating to objects / object oriented programmning (OOP)

## Table of Contents

  - [...](basic-functions.py)

## Notes

Object Oriented Programming (OOP) - Introduction:

- Codified respresentation of real world objects
- Class: Template for e.g. coins is a class
- Objects are instances of a class
- OOP principle of encapsulation: states can be encapsulated

- Class are made of variables (states) and functions (methods)
- Each varible type in python (e.g. string) is its own unique class (defined by states and methods)

Class constructors and class destructers
- construcotrs help to setup object states
- constructor: def__init__(self): #function with self as paramenter # self: specific instance of a class #used to construct classes states
- destructors: def__del__(self)

## Built With

- The code challenge solutions use [Python](https://www.python.org/)
